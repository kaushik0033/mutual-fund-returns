### Project Overview

 To predict the Basis point spread over AAA-rated bonds
Basis point means the additional return on the mutual fund would give over the AAA-rated bond


### Learnings from the project

 How to splitting Test and Train dataset
How to use for sci-kit-learn library
How to apply a linear model using following -
**
Chi square contengency test
Box plot
Linear regression
GridsearchCV
Ridge and Lasso Regressor**


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Understand the problem first, do a data analysis and try to use sci-kit-learn library to fit a best model and do testing.
